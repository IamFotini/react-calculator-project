# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Calculator User Story

As a User
I want to perform basic calculations such as (addition, subtraction, division & multiplication) for whole as well as decimal numbers and have the capacity to clear the display box
So that I could get correct calculations

Acceptance Criteria

Given I have the number 2021 and the number 2003
When I subtract the two inputs
Then I should get Total of 18

```

Business Requirement

‘ A calculator app to perform standard math functions such as: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Designed to look similar to a handheld calculator and user friendly with large buttons and large display with a vivid contrast between numbers and background. Created using purely react and no other frameworks as in math.js When the numbers are clicked, they are then displayed into the input area at the top of the calculator by using the handleclick method. A clear button is displayed at the bottom so when clicked, characters in the display field are cleared out. ‘

Functional Requirements
• F01: Consists of large buttons (0-9) and characters (, /\*-+= and clear)
• F02: Able to store input into memory
• F03: Able to perform standard arithmetic operations
• F04: Able to clear display output
• F05: User should be able to correct wrongly entered input by pressing the clear button
• .

Non-Functional Requirements

• Design of calculator should be user friendly and clearly and well displayed. Buttons should be a good size and clearly labeled for user ease
• Buttons should follow the standard layout of a universal calculator with the operators on the right hand side for user friendliness
Performance-Based
• There shouldn’t be along delay for the output when making calculations

The definition of a functional requirement is:
“Any Requirement Which Specifies What The System Should Do.”

In other words, a functional requirement will describe a particular behavior or function of the system when certain conditions are met, for example:“Send email when a new customer signs up” or “Open a new account”.

A functional requirement for an everyday object like a cup would be: “ability to contain tea or coffee without leaking”. It defines functions with their related data. The end goal of a project is to deliver a high quality product exactly as the customer asked for. Functional requirements are the primary way that a customer communicates their requirements to the project team. Functional requirements help to keep project teams going in the right direction.

Knowing the difference between functional and non-functional requirements prevents failure and helps both the client and the IT supplier as they’re able to understand their requirements clearly.

The definition of a non-functional requirement is:
“Any Requirement That Specifies How The System Performs A Certain Function.”

In other words, a non-functional requirement will describe how a system should behave and what limits there are on its functionality.
Non-functional requirements cover all the remaining requirements which are not covered by the functional requirements. They specify criteria that judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours, for example: “Modified data in a database should be updated for all users accessing it within 2 seconds.”
A non-functional requirement for the cup mentioned previously would be: “contain hot liquid without heating up to more than 45°C”.
